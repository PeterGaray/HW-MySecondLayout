<!-- 
Make sure you put the 'content' of your page within the <body> tags, and not into the head tag.

Also, the <footer> should be part of the <body> tag and not live outside of it.

Well structured and well written code. Easy for other developers to follow.

Instead of having so many different <section>s , better practice is to make 1 larger section, and use <div>s instead of several sections. Section can be like a larger body that contains smaller parts of the page. (your code is correct, there is nothing wrong, but it would improve readability a little bit more)

Good start with media queries.
Be careful when defining max width (like for the video) in pixels. It may not look great when on a smaller screen

When doing hover, standard way to write the css classes is: .NameOfClass:hover, not :hover.NameOfClass

That way we know right away which class we are talking about
